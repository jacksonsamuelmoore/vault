# Calculating the speed of sound using air resonance
## Equipment
- Signal Generator
- Oscilloscope
- Metre rule
- Tube
- Loudspeaker
- Connecting leads
- Power pack
- Boss and clamp
## Method 
1.  Set up the apparatus as shown.
2.  Fill the tube with water up to approximately three quarters of its height.
3.  Take measurements to determine the distance from the top of the tube to the surface of the water.
4.  Position the speaker above the tube and adjust the frequency until the level of sound increases indicating resonance.
5.  Use the oscilloscope to determine the frequency of the signal.
6.  Keeping the signal at the same frequency, reduce the water level until a new resonant point is identified.
7.  Take measurements to determine the distance from the top of the tube to the surface of the water.
8.  Repeat the experiment to obtain additional readings, continuing to maintain the same frequency.
9.  Use this data to determine the wavelength of the sound wave.
10.  Using the calculated wavelength and measured frequency, determine the speed of sound in air.

## Data
Measured Frequency: 5000Hz
	-> Time/Div: 0.2ms
	-> Time Period: $2*10^4$
Wavelength: $2*5=10cm=0.1m$
	-> Harmonic 1: 31.5cm
	-> Harmonic 2: 36.5cm
	
=> Speed of sound = 0.1*5000=500m/s 

## Errors
Measurement of the meniscus: We used our ears and only one measurement to find the different harmonics. This could cause many errors as we are unable to tell where a perfect standing wave has formed.

## Conclusion
The experiment was not really a success. The value of the speed of sound calculated was quite off. If I were to do this experiment again I would have measured more harmonics and averaged the distance for wavelength. I would also have likely tried to more precise equipment to find the each harmonic, as using just ears is not very reliable.
