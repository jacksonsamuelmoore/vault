# Investigating Oscillations
## Aim
To test and verify that the equation $\omega ^2 = {k\over m}$ is true for simple harmonic motion
## Method
1. Set up a spring in a hanging position.
2. Measure a mass and record it as the value of $m$
3. Attach the mass to the spring
4. Pull the spring down a fixed amount (record the value, it will be used again)
5. Release the spring-mass combination and measure the time taken for the spring to return to it's starting position 5 times with a stop watch
7. Use that time to calculate $\omega ^2$
8. Repeat with several different masses using the same fixed distance
9. Plot a graph of $\omega ^2$ against $1 \over m$
10. Confirm that the line of best fit is roughly a straight line crossing the origin

## Errors
### On $\omega^2$
Fixed error on T: 0.01s
Percentage error on T (average): 0.385%
Percent error on $\omega^2$: 0.771%
<1%: Negligible
### On $m$
None

### Systematic
Constant slight effect of friction (air resistance)
Slight delay on initial extension 
Result: Line of best fit not perfectly through origin
