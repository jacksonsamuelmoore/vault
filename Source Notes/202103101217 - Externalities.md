# Externalities Revision

## Starter

1. Define:
   - Externality: The effect of producing or consuming a good on a third party
   - Information Failure (Myopia): When consumers discount future benefits or costs
   - Merit good: A good associated with positive externalities and often under produced
   - Government failure: When the government does not intervene or intervenes incorrectly leading to market failure/dead weight welfare loss
2. Draw a diagram to show a good with negative consumption externalities ![[Pasted image 20210310122616.png]]
   In this market, externalities exist because MSB<MPB. Market produces at private optimum MPB:MPC (P1Q1). As social optimum is MSB:MSC (P2Q2), market failure exists and over consumption of good exists
3. Draw a diagram to show the effect of a subsidy on cycling
	- Push out supply
	- Produce now at social optimum
