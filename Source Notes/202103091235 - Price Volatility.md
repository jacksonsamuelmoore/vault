# How can price volatility lead to market failure

#Marco #Market-Failure #Elasticity

## Starter

- The term price volatility is used to describe price fluctuations
- Volatility is measured by the size of the day-to-day movements
- The degree of variation is the important thing

## The coffee price problem

- General upward trend on price _and_ production
- Strange - as typically production shift supply out and reduce price
- Solution: A greater increase in demand occurred in the same time frame, increasing price

## With the aid of a diagram, explain why avocados are price volatile

(Diagrams.net not working)

- Inelastic supply as avocados are a seasonal fruit and producers cannot produce more to match prices (agricultural goods)
- Inelastic demand in short run
- When supply shifts inward, it raises the price majorly due to the inelastic demand curve
- The same would happen with a change in demand
- This is price volatility

## Exam question: Explain why supply of manufactured goods tend to be more elastic than that of agricultural goods

Manufactured goods:

- Can be stored for long periods
- Can be increased all year round
- Production can be scaled up easily
- Can be made quickly

Agricultural goods:

- Are made slowly
- Spoil
- Are fixed to one season
- Cannot be scaled easily

## Why are groups unhappy with price volatility

### Producers

This is a problem for producers as they can't predict their future revenue, which means that they will be uncertain and won't invest as much

### Consumers

- Could be hit with high prices
- Rarely hit with low prices due to middlemen

### Governments

- Uncertain tax revenue
- Can't invest in infrastructure
- Particularly a problem for developing countries as a barrier to development
  - Impossible to commit to schemes in long run
  - Falling prices reduce terms of trade
  - Falling prices create cost push inflation

## Volatility chain of analysis

1. Good harvest increases supply
2. Price falls
3. Some businesses no longer viable and others switch production
4. This reduces supply below where it started
5. This raises the price
6. New entrants are attracted to the market and other switch back
7. Increases supply
8. Return to step 2

Products with inelastic supply and demand will diverge further the average and see greater volatility
