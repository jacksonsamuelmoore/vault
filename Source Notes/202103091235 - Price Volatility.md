# How can price volatility lead to market failure

#Marco #Market-Failure #Elasticity

## Starter

- The term price volatility is used to describe price fluctuations
- Volatility is measured by the size of the day-to-day movements
- The degree of variation is the important thing

## The coffee price problem

- General upward trend on price _and_ production
- Strange - as typically production shift supply out and reduce price
- Solution: A greater increase in demand occurred in the same time frame, increasing price

## With the aid of a diagram, explain why avocados are price volatile

(Diagrams.net not working)

- Inelastic supply as avocados are a seasonal fruit and producers cannot produce more to match prices (agricultural goods)
- Inelastic demand in short run
- When supply shifts inward, it raises the price majorly due to the inelastic demand curve
- The same would happen with a change in demand
- This is price volatility

## Exam question: Explain why supply of manufactured goods tend to be more elastic than that of agricultural goods

Manufactured goods:

- Can be stored for long periods
- Can be increased all year round
- Production can be scaled up easily
- Can be made quickly

Agricultural goods:

- Are made slowly
- Spoil
- Are fixed to one season
- Cannot be scaled easily
## Why are groups unhappy with price volatility
### Producers
This is a problem for producers as they can't predict their future revenue, which means that they will be uncertain and won't invest as much. Price volatility could be
### Consumers
- Could be hit with high prices
- Rarely hit with low prices due to middlemen
### Governments
- Uncertain tax revenue
- Can't invest in infrastructure
- Particularly a problem for developing countries as a barrier to development
	- Impossible to commit to schemes in long run
	- Falling prices reduce terms of trade
	- Falling prices create cost push inflation
