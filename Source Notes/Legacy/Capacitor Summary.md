### Equations

$C=\frac{Q}{V}\\F=\frac{1C}{1V}\\Q=CV \text{ (reason for line graph of Q vs V)}$

### When is a capacitor "discharged"

$V=V_0e^{-t/RC}\\V=V_0e^{-RC/RC}=V_0/e\approx 0.37V_0$ ← RC (Time constant) is the time it take to get to 0.37 of itself

The standard for discharge is when $t\approx(5,6)RC$

### In parallel

$Q_{TOT}=Q_1+Q_2\\C_{TOT}V_{TOT}=C_1V_1+C_2V_2\\C_{TOT}=C_1+C_2$

These are the opposite formula to resistors - as capacitors and resistors have opposite functions

### In series

$V_{TOT}=V_1+V_2\\Q_1=Q_2\\Q_{TOT}/C_{TOT}=Q_1/C_1+Q_2/C_2\\1/C_{TOT}=1/C_1+1/C_2$
