### Opening observations

The most major thing I noticed exiting this exam was the time pressure. While I felt that for most of the exam I understood the content of the questions and was able to give decent, though not perfect answers, these came much too slowly. There is some aspect of this that I might contribute to the online nature of the exam and the exam day technical issues, but even that wouldn't recover that pace I needed to be on. Plain and simple: I was too slow.

### Section 1: Content issues

One of the main areas where I missed marks was question C. While my memory isn't quite clear, I either had a different question or had some large trouble reading that question, so as was clearly pointed out, I really didn't answer the question and received no marks. This question will of course need to be rewritten.

I also lost marks on the first 10 mark question. There were some parts I missed and content I should have added.

To get more marks I should have:

- Talk more about the different effects of falling and rising AD
- Include that global trends will effect our economy
- Include the evaluation that move will depend on the governments stance on economic policy
- Talk about priorities of the bank of England and the government

### Section 2: Speed

Here I'm going to focus on speed

I'm going to attempt to write a rewrite of question c and also roughly plan the final 10 mark question on exam pace which is about 2 mins a mark

Question C: Using an appropriate diagram, outline possible causes of the change in the value of the pound at the start of Friday the 24th June

After the Brexit vote, major uncertainty in the market would likely cause large amount of speculative selling of the pound. This increases the supply of the pound, shown in the shift S-S1. This creates an extension along the demand curve, leading to a falling in "the price of pounds" or the value of the pound compared to other currencies

Question E: Using an appropriate diagram and with reference to the data, evaluate the economic
effects of UK tariffs being imposed on products imported from the rest of the EU

Diagram: Tariff Diagram

Points:

- Rising costs for domestic businesses get worse
    - Causes more cost push inflation
- Reduced balance of payments due to more spending domestic
    - Increased traffic for domestic businesses leads to AD rise
- Could be used to nurture industries
    - Though retaliation could stop that
- Overall depend on size of tarrifs, state of economy
    - Could cause much welfare loss
    - Could not
