Sub-unit: Magnetic Fields
Type: Notes
Unit(s): Particles and Medical Physics

### Starter

1. Permanent magnet - Permanent
2. Ferromagnetism - Associated with metals
3. Para-magnetism - Internal magnetism

### Poles

North and south poles

Never observed on their own

### Fields

Field: A region of pace surrounding a permanent magnet or a current carrying conductor in which magnetic objects experience a force

From north to south

Field lines get farther apart as you get further away - weaker at more distance

### Current Carrying conductor

Right hand rule: Fingers give field line, thumb current direction

The fields are just concentric circles

The density of the field line is the strength, or magnetic flux

### Interactions

$B=F/IL$ where B is flux density, I is current, F is catapult force, and L is length of wire

### Qs

1. 0.033 Tesla
