### Starter

4. Supply of £ rises
5. Govt. worries about money leaving the circular flow

6. The lower prices cause our level of exports to rise and hence demand for pounds to rise. This corrects the current account balance and brings the exchange rate to what it was

### Evaluation

Unfortunately, the exchange rate does not actually work in practice. In practice, speculation much more heavily causes changes in the exchange rate, meaning it can often end up where the exchange rate doesn't represent the true value.

### Terms

Depreciation: The value of a floating currency falling

Example: The UK pound lost 15% of it's value the night of the Brexit referendum due to a toxic combination of falling demand and rising supply

Devaluation: The value of a fixed currency falling

### How do I fix a currency?

Interventions to "prop up" a currency:

- Foreign reserves → Increase supply
    - Eg Denmark
- Interest rates → Increase demand for currency
    - Eg Denmark
- Limiting exchange → limits supply and demand movement
    - Eg Argentina, China
