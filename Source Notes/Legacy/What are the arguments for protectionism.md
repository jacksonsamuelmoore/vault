### Potential reasons for

- Other countries will cripple exports and businesses
- Protecting domestic jobs
- Reduces competition ⇒ increased domestic profits
- Source of government revenue

> We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying out jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength - Donald Trump

## Infant industries

### Infant industry argument

Infant industries are industries within a county that has not yet had the chance to grow to the point it could compete internationally.  The argument it to block imports for a limited amount of time to allow it to mature.

This can easily go wrong if the threat of competition is entirely removed, as shown by the Brazilian computer industries in the 1990's, which ended up very far behind the world standards

### Why should developing countries use the infant industry argument?

1. Developing nations often have primary sector imports that have very volatile prices - eg. oil
2. The terms of trade makes it so that the price of manufactured goods rises faster than that of raw materials, meaning that countries want to create manufacturing industries

### Issues with infant industries

> Because brazil is such a closed economy, it ends up having very low productivity compared to more developed countries. If you are more competitive you become more productive - and for that you need to be more open and integrated into global value chains - Gabriel Petrus (ICC)

Protectionism can cause consumer to pay far to much for a inferior quality good

## Self sufficiency

### The self sufficiency argument

Another argument for protectionism is self sufficiency, which can be very important for some nations, but also requires protecting domestic businesses. For example, when the pandemic hit in early 2020, PPE production was happing in China, in areas which were shut down. This exposed a reliance on imports which wouldn't be there if we were more self sufficient

> For an island nation, being able to feed our nation is absolutely critical. Even as a global trading nation, shocks can expose fragilities in any reliance on imports - Minette Batters, NFU

## Sunset industries

Some very old industries begin to die out due to them being non-viable, but removing them quickly can have drastic effects. The argument is to use protectionism to slow the decline and allow them to die gracefully and preventing a large crash

An argument against this is that it stands in the way of creative destruction, stopping new industries  from prospering with new and more efficient idea.

## Anti-dumping

> Steel is a big problem. I mean they're dumping steel [...] They're dumping steel and destroying our steel industry - Donald Trump

An anti-dumping duty is a tariff leveraged on importers pricing their goods below market price. International competitors often export their goods and sell them cheaply to establish market share.

The issue is that this gives governments control to say exactly what is and isn't fair market value, allowing for potential discrimination.

## Ha-Joon Chang - Debunking the free trade myth

> History shows that developing countries need protectionist policies to develop their infant industries

The myth: All countries become better from free trade

Between 1830 and the end of the second world war, the US had the highest tariff levels in the world. They greatly benefited from this and are now pressuring other countries to not to use the same tools they used to become wealthy
