2. Draw perfect competition

3. Are monopolies/perfect competition efficient

Perfect competition: allocation - yes

### Contestability

- Competition forces cutting of prices to create efficient outcomes for society
- This is a problem sometimes, as it causes lack of choice and motivation for improvement
- Contestability still allows for product of differentiation and small amount of firms, etc. but requires a market to have a credible threat of entry, forcing them to innovate and not to take anti-competitive actions
- All markets are a little bit contestable but its needed that barriers to entry are low to create contestable markets
- Technology is creating more and more contestable markets
- Contestable markets show high dynamic efficiency

### Creating contestable markets

- Want to move LRAC to the left
- So the MES is at a much smaller quantity
- Done by reducing fixed costs

### Changes to markets

Hotel/Room sharing:

Innovation in the industry in the form of markets like Airbnb have allowed for much lower fixed costs, raising competition and causing prices to be greatly lowered. This has also created more efficiency as hotels are force to lower prices and innovate in fear of competition

The preferred pricing strategy produced by contestable markets is limit pricing

It is allocatively quite efficient because the threat of competition forces them to lower prices to the lowest points on their cost curves
