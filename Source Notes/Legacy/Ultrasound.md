### Starter

- Ultrasound is and sound wave where the frequency is higher than human hearing (25000Hz)
- Sound waves are propagating fluctuation of the the density of the matter

### Production

- Uses piezoelectric crystals (F→V or V→F)
- Apply a voltage to a piezoelectric crystal will create detectable ultra sound
- Examples:
    - Quartz
    - Zirconate
- Contracts/expands by ~1%
    - $\varepsilon=e/l\approx{1/.1}$
- Transducer is both produce and receive

### Uses

- Pre-natal scans
- Heart Scan

### Scans

Simple (A scan):

- Pulse sent into the body
- Graph V vs T
- Depth of tissue determined by time to recieved
- $Ct*2d$ where c is propagation velocity

Imaging (B scan):

- Uses many A scans and a computer
- Creates a 2d image
