### Explain the possible ways in which a government may implement protectionist policies

Protectionist policies fall broadly into two categories, them being tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Each of the different methods of implementation has different advantages and disadvantages, but all aim to achieve the same goal - protect domestic businesses and ensure that it is harder or less profitable for overseas producers.

The most common and discussed form of protectionism is be tariffs. These are payment taken by the government based on the value and type of import in exchange for being able to import that goods. These are very easily implemented, and are in fact implemented by default for WTO members. These discourage international businesses by raising there costs, hence causing a reduction in supply

Now onto non-tariff barriers. The most basic of these is the trusty embargo. This exceedingly simple policy simply bars all imports coming from one or multiple countries. This forces consumers only to buy from the domestic producers. Embargos are often levied as a political tool, and are a very blunt measure to protect domestic firms. In addition to the embargo, there is his younger brother, the trade licence. Trade licences are another simple way to restrict which firms can and can't sell into a market, without outright blocking them, by granting permission to only specific firms. Licences are often used in a more positive way, such as restriction on pharmaceuticals in the UK, but could very easily be open to corruption.

The next group of policies focus on methods of making domestic goods cheaper the international ones. These help protect domestic firms by ensuring that the consumer picks them over another using the price motive. State aid is an example of one such policy, where the government gives money in one form or another to domestic businesses. This cuts costs, pushes out supply and lowers prices, allowing these businesses an advantage over international ones. In a similar vein is competitive devaluation. This is a more hard-to-catch strategies, whereby the government devalues the local currency. This makes it cheaper for the international community to buy these goods, protecting the firm from international competition.

Second to last comes the different admin barriers. Safety standards, border checks and other legal red tape, when used excessively, can incur huge costs to importing into a country, with forms to fill and checks to pass. While sometimes this cost is passed to the consumer, these methods still act as a semi-hidden tariff, directly discouraging international firms and protecting local businesses.

Finally we come to quotas and VERs. This are used to limit not the what or how of a good, but the amount. These again often used as political ways, such as how the US forced japan into creating VERs on cars in the 1980, ensuring they limited their own export of the goods. Quotas work in a similar way, bus are set up by the receiver, who limits the amount of a good that can be imported, such as the UK's proposed steel quota in an attempt thwart Chinese protectionism and supposed currency devaluation

### Which of the following is unlikley to reduce imports?

A - an appreciation of the exchange rate would only make it easier for domestic consumers to buy imports with their now very strong currency
