### Starter

What can I remember about the WTO?

The world trade organisation

The world trade organization has 164 members

### What are the aims and functions of the WTO?

> The WTO seeks to promote free and harmonious trade between nations

- Administering trade agreements
- forum of negotiation
- handling disputes
- monitor policies
- help developing countries with assistance and training

### What are the rules?

The rules followed by the WTO are the Most favoured nation rules

This means:

- You cannot discriminate between countries in terms of trade, so all trade policies such as tariffs and customs checks are the same for everyone
- The only exception is if you have a free trade deal with a country

This effects Brexit, as unless the UK negotiates a deal with the EU, the tariffs will be almost 80%, inline with all other non-trade deal countries

- This actually was used, as the WRO recently solved a trade dispute between with EU and 11 Latin American countries. As evaluation point of the WTO, is somewhat absurd that the case took 20 years to close the case, displaying significant lack of power

### Benefits of the WTO

1. The system helps promote peace
2. Disputes are handled constructively
3. Rules make life easier for all
4. Freer trade cuts the costs of living
5. It provides more choice of products and qualities
6. Trade between countries raises incomes and growth

### Disadvantages of the WTO

Many countries including the US say the that WTO has problems in several major areas

These are:

- Intellectual property rights
- Removal of sovereignty
- Inadequate product and labour regulations
- Import competitions
