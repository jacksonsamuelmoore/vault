### Energy stored in capacitors

$C=50\mu F;V=60V$

1. $C=Q/V\rArr Q=3mC$
2. $W=1/2QV=2.5*10^{-5}J$ ⛔
3. $Q=4.1\dot{6}*10^{-7}\rArr W=5*10^{-5}$⛔
4. $W\propto V^2$
5. $C=1000\mu F;W=2J\\V=$

### Difference between a battery and a capacitor

In a battery, every charge is passed through a potential difference of 10V. Comparatively, in a capacitor the the voltage changes with each additional charge. This means that each charge doesn't go through 10V and in fact on average go through half that, which is shown by the area under the curve for a  Q vs V graph
