### Black Wednesday Questions

1. What is a 'semi-fixed mechanism'

    Currency were fixed only in bounds with one another, and had some leeway as to floating

2. Interventions:

    The government would either sell off foreign reserves or raise interest rates. Raising interest rate was a particularly surprising move as this is bad for an economy in a recession

3. What lead to the ultimate fall of the pound

    A large amount of investors followed Soros in suit and sold the pound, decreasing the value so much that the Central Bank was forced to give in with attempts to correct it

4. What was the outcome

    The UK suspended its membership of the ERM and let the pound crash
