### Starter

Does capacitance change with:

- Area of the plates: Yes (more surface for charge build up)
- Distance between the plates: Yes, more distance weakens electric field and hence electrons are attracted to the plate less, hence decreased capacitance

### Capacitance dependencies

Does capacitance change with:

- Area of the plates: Yes (more surface for charge build up)
- Distance between the plates: Yes, more distance weakens electric field and hence electrons are attracted to the plate less, hence decreased capacitance

$C={\varepsilon A\over d}\\\varepsilon=\varepsilon_r\varepsilon_0$ where $\varepsilon$ relates to the field permittivity in the material between the plates and C is in Farads

Some insulators allow charges to rotate freely, and when a field is applied they polarise in the opposite direction to the field in accordance with attraction. This means they create a small opposite electric field, reducing the strength of the field. Better insulators allows the charges to shift less and hence have stronger fields and allow for higher capacitance

### Q1

$m=0.0112=C=Q/V\\C={\varepsilon A\over d}=0.0112\\\varepsilon=0.0112/{20.5\pi \over 2.5}=4.5*10^{-4}$
