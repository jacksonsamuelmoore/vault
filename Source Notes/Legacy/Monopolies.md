### Degrees of monopoly

Example: Google

- P: High
- I: Asymeteric
- N: Few/One
- S: Huge
- I: High
- D: High
- E: High

Examples of power levels:

- TFL: Near 100% 'Pure'
- Pepsi/Coke: 50% 'Duopoly'
- Costa: 40% 'Dominant firm'
- Tesco: 25% 'Working monopoly'

A pure monopoly is a firm with 100% share, however in reality, the UKCMA defines a monopolistic firm as one with 25%+ share.

### Weighing up

Advantages:

- Economies of scale
- Dynamic Efficiency
- Natural Monopoly
- International competition

Disadvantages:

- Allocatively inefficient

    Consumers paid higher than perfect competition

- Productively inefficient

    Costs are higher because artificial supply restriction

- X inefficient
- Buy up competitors → Increase barriers to entry

### Should we break them up?

I like monopolies that innovate and expand their products to keep the monopoly

I don't like monopolies that use their power to raise barriers to entry and exploit consumers

### Natural monopolies

1. Sunk/fixed costs are very high, so AC falls
2. Firm produces at MR=LRMC (P1Q1)
3. Government intervenes and forces AR=LRMC → Allocatively efficient

### Discuss the extent to which monopoly markets are desirable in developed economies?

I like monopolies that innovate and expand their products to keep the monopoly, that are natural monopolies and are supported by government

I don't like monopolies that use their power to raise barriers to entry and exploit consumers

## Price discrimination

### Types

There are 3 different types: Time, place, income

- First Degree: Charging different prices for different individuals
    - Increased revenue/profit
    - Decreased brand loyalty
    - Can only be done with a strong market position
    - Bad for society
- Second Degree: Changing prices by quantity sold or time of pruchase

    eg. Bulk buying/Peak Travel pricing

- Third Degree: Changing price based on groups of consumers
    - More revenue/profit for firms
    - Effectively exploiting consumers - removes consumer surplus
