### Finding the speed of an electron

$E_k=E_e={1\over 2}mv^2=QV$ (From $V={energy\over Q}$)

Assuming a vacuum and 100% efficient - no slowing effect

Over 64000, $v=1.5*10^8={c\over 2}$

$v=c\implies V=2.56*10^5$

### Questions

1. $E=V/d=100000000/400=250000N/C$
2. $W=qEd=100J$
3. Closer plates is more force; More charge is more force
4. A: $F=VQ/d\implies V\propto a$
5. B (See diagram)
6. Speed is effected by voltage, mass and charge
7. D: $_3^6\text{Li}^{2+}$ is lightest and most charged
8. $F=VQ/d$
9. $VQ$

Annotations:

- Thermionic emission at hot cathode
- Horizontal acceleration = 0
- Deflection plates create uniform field
- Even with 0 potential at the bottom, there is PD as there is positive at the top

Thermionic emission is when an element is heated and emits electrons

Example Q:

Deflection plates: 1000V

Tube length: 0.3m

Hence distance fallen due to gravity: $5*10^{-15}m$

(Working not written)

Part 2:

Deflection plates: 0.08m long, 0.05cm apart, 400V

Therefore distance displaced is 0.013m, or 1.3cm
