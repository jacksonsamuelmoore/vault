    1. Gravitational attraction between nearby galaxies affects motion
    2. Expansion of the universe was non-constant
6. .

    1. No - They are made up of quarks
    2. Electron, positron
9. .
    1. The aluminium nucleus must move away from the alpha particle (ie to the right). This is because of the repulsive force between the two particles
    2. speed = $2.0 × 10^7 m/s$
    3. $4.7 × 10^{–15} m$
    4. The strong nuclear force is attractive at long distances but repulsive at short distances, which means that when the particles are so close together the forces become high repulsive
10. .
    1. $\lambda = 1.2*10^{–12} m$
    2. $2/3e, -1/3e$
11. .
    1. It acts between quarks. Repulsive below approx. 0.5 fm. Attractive up to about 3 fm
    2. .
        1. proton = u u d
        2.  $d\rarr u + _{-1}^0e$
    3. Mass $\propto$ A

        V $\propto r^3\propto A$

        $\therefore \rho=m/V=A/A$
