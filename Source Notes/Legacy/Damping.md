### Types

Light damping is when energy is slowly removed from the system, several oscillations may occur

Heavy damping is when energy is removed so fast that only one oscillation is possible.

Critical damping is when the energy is removed so quickly that no oscillations occur

Free oscillation: When the system operates without the input if energy extra energy

Forced oscillation: When extra energy is used to force the object to oscillate

> Natural frequency: the frequency of the free oscillations of a system moving in SHM

### Resonance

> The tendency of a system to oscillate with greater amplitude at a given frequency. This frequency is known as the natural or resonant frequency. When a driving force matches this frequency, a system will resonate

When there is forced resonance at the

4. pushing your sibling at the top of the swing means that the driving force you are creating is at the same frequency of the swinging, or to say you are only ever adding energy to the oscillation in the same direction as the swing, and when it is moving slowest
