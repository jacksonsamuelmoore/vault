### Starter

- Currency union:  Distinguished from a full monetary union, this is where parties share a common currency but no other aspects of monetary policy

### Features of Monetary Unions

- Shared monetary policy:
    - Common bank rate
    - Currency issued by central bank
- Common currency
- Shared Central Bank
- Fiscal Harmonisation
    - Members must meet criteria before joining and maintain similar economies to the rest of the group

### Convergence Criteria

Measure how able they are to join the union:

- Price stability
- Sound public finances, to ensure sustainable economies
- Exchange-rate stability, showing long-term management abilities
- Long-term interest rates, assessing how well they'll do without interest rates as a tool

### Costs and benefits

Benefits:

- Lower transaction costs
- Greater price transparency
- Eliminate exchange uncertainty
- Increased trade and investment within the union
- Promotes discipline in managing finances

Costs:

- Loss of independent monetary policy: Exchange rates and QE handled by central bank
- High costs of leaving
- Cannot restore competitiveness through devaluation due to one single currency
- No lender of last resort

### Case Study: Greece

For a union to work the countries need roughly the same needs. After the financial crisis some countries recovered and others did not. Greece was one of these, with largely noncompetitive products.

1. What is a consequence of this?
    - Not exporting and importing more
    - ⇒ Slow growth
2. What might it normaly do?

    Devalue the currency

 3. What prevented it from doing this?

The control of the currency by the monetary union

> Monetary unions are much like dinner parties, where everyone needs to have common diet requirements so they can eat the dish served

"Why didn't they just leave?"

- Could cause domino effect
- Drachma would be massively devalued compared to the euro
- Greece couldn't pay back debt
- Change power balance in EU
- Couldn't borrow
- Falls in Greek living standard

Alternative? Bailouts from other states with an agreement to austerity measures
