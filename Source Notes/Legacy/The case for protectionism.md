### Starter

1. Tariffs vs Administrative barriers

    Tariffs can't fully stop sellers, only discourage them, and are often cause international retaliation compared with Admin barriers which are more discrete. However tariffs provide government revenue.

2. Tariffs vs Quotas

    Tariffs provide government revenue whereas quotas do not

3. VER vs Quotas

    POV protectionist courtiers, VERs are worse because they provide less control

### Example: India

Another form of protectionism is export subsidies: India "sweetened the deal" for sugar producers with a $141.86/tonne subsidy, adding to the competitiveness of Indian sugar.

India planned to pay for subsidies with taxes, but COVID means they now cannot afford them

Disadvantage: Subsidies are more expensive than other forms of protectionism

### Impact of differing standards

Standards add more border checks and slow down flows of goods. Even adding 80 seconds of checks at Dover is said to cause up to 6-day traffic jams and queues around the port

### EU trade deal

- Environmental standards: can't create maliciously high standards
- State aid: can't give state aid
- Workers rights: can't reduce rights
- Product standards: can't lower local standards

Non-regression vs dynamic alignment: The UK doesn't want to have to keep up with EU standards (dynamic alignment), and instead want to promise not to lower their standards (non-regression)

For the EU to remove their tariffs, they must be sure that the UK won't artificially boost their own businesses
