### Equations

Gravitational field strength is force per unit mass ⇒ Electric field strength is force per unit charge

$E={F  \over Q}$

$W=F*d\\Eq=F\\W=qEd\\W/q=V\\W=Vq=qEd\implies V=Ed\implies E=V/d$

$d$: Distance between the plates

$W$: Work done/energy

$F$: Force

$E$: Field strength

$V$: Voltage

$Q$: Charge

## Kinematics

### 1-Dimensional

$E_k=E_e={1\over 2}mv^2=QV$ (From $V={energy\over Q}$)

This can be used to find distances and times of travel

Assuming a vacuum and 100% efficient - no slowing effect

### 2-Dimensional Motion

Details:

- Thermionic emission at hot cathode
- Horizontal acceleration = 0 between deflection plates
- Deflection plates create uniform field
- Even with 0 potential at the bottom, there is PD as there is positive at the top

Thermionic emission is when an element is heated and emits electrons
