### Electric fields

Revision:

- Closer field lines ⇒ stronger field force
- Area of effect
- Have direction
- Relevant to charge (not current as we only learn static fields)

### Gravitational field review

1. What is a field? A region of space where a mass experiences a gravitational force.
2. Name the two types of gravitational field. Uniform and radial
3. Sketch the earths field:

    Points going into the earth

4. Further away field lines
5. Gravitational field strength is the amount of force applied to a unit of mass
6. N/kg
7. Gravitational potential: The work done per unit mass to bring a mass from infinity to point $r$
8.  GPE: See above, no longer over mass

$g=\frac{F}{m}$

### Similarities and differences

1. Height vs potential difference
2. Both "Fall down" hill, either gravitational potential or electric potential
3. High energy to low energy
4. Both add kinetic energy

### Electric Fields

Electric field lines point away from positive charge, either radially or uniformly

They're much stronger than gravitational fields, so can be manipulated

> Rule: Field lines cannot cross, so in the inner of a sphere will have no field
