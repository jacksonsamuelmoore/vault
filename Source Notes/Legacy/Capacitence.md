### Method

The EMF pushes electrons around the circuit and the pile up at the insulated barrier. They push away the electrons on the other side of the capacitor causing a charge difference

### Useage

If setup in parallel to a component with a switch, the electrons can be released to the component, providing a burst of charge

### Equations

$C=\frac{Q}{V}\\F=\frac{1C}{1V}\\Q=CV \text{ (reason for line graph of Q vs V)}$

### Questions

1. $24\mu A*38=9.12*10^{-4}$
2. $Q/V=Q/4.2=2.17*10^{-4}F$
3. $(14\mu A*50)/4.2=1.67*10^{-4}$

### In parallel

$Q_{TOT}=Q_1+Q_2\\C_{TOT}V_{TOT}=C_!V_!+C_2V_2\\C_{TOT}=C_1+C_2$

These are the opposite formula to resistors - as capacitors and resistors have opposite functions

### In series

$V_{TOT}=V_1+V_2\\Q_1=Q_2\\Q_{TOT}/C_{TOT}=Q_1/C_1+Q_2/C_2\\1/C_{TOT}=1/C_1+1/C_2$

### Questions (again)

1. $1.5\mu F+4.5\mu F = 6\mu F$
2. $6V$
3. $6V :A \\3V:B=C$
