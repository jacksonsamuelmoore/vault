### Corrections

1. None
2. .
    1. (a) None
    2. (b) (i) Uncertainty taken by the largest distance between the maximum or minimum values logged. $ln(2.8)-0.10=0.07$

        (b) (ii) Line of best fit required

        (b) (iii) $\text{gradient}=6.6*10^4\\C={6.6\over 6.6*10^4}=0.3*10^{-4}F$

    3. (c) $ln(0.1)={-15\over RC}\\R=0.65/C=28k\Omega$
3. .
    1. (i) $extention= 1.6*10^{-4}$ + Specifically assume obeys hook's law

### Plan

Too work on:

- Percentage and absolute error
    - Focus on specifically absolute - take complex situation where transformations are involved
- Young's Modulus stress/stain questions
    - Specifically focus on principle examples
    - And also q's with unit conversions and other complications

## Other homework assessments review

### Particle Physics, Stars and Cosmology

- While I got this mostly right at the time some parts need review
- Particularly particle physics - most of that is just memory work, so review is in order

### SHM and Thermodynamics

- Thermodynamics is mostly simple, very little review required here
- SHM could do with a little review, a quick reminder of which formula to use where
- Did well on this test, mostly no issues

### Medical Physics

- This one could do with some work, again it's a lot of memory of what goes where
- Some hefty review of Saturday school's resources would do good here

## Final rough checklist

- Errors
- Young's modulus
- SHM
- Medical physics
- Particle physics
