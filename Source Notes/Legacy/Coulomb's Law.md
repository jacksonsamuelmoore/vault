### Starter

1. What do we know about gravitational force?
    - It's strength is proportional to the distance from the field
2. Any 2 objects exert a force:
    - That is proportional to the product of the masses
    - and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them

### Coulomb's law

For newton's law:

$F={-GMm\over r^2}$

Objects exert force that is

- That is proportional to the product of the masses
- and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them

So for coulomb's law:

$F={kQq\over r^2}={Qq\over 4\pi \varepsilon_0 r^2}$

Where Q and q are charge, r is distance between charges and $\varepsilon_0\approx8.85*10^{-12}F/m$

Objects exert force that is

- That is proportional to the product of the charges
- and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them

The electric permittivity of a medium describes how much electric field (more correctly, flux) is generated per unit charge in it (to do with the alignment of molecules with the field

### Example Q

$0.53*10^{-10}=r\\F=ke^2/r^2=-8.2*10^{-8}$

### Question sheet

1. $F_e=2.3*10^{-28}N\\F_g=5.5*10^{-71}N$ ← Weaker by $\approx10^{{42}}$
2. $F_e=2.3*10^{-28}N\\F_g=1.9*10^{-64}N$
3. Because earth has low charge and so do people, but a earth has a huge mass
4.
