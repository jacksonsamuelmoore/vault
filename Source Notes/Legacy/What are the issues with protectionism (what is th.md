### Protectionism

Government measures that limit imports into a country with the intent of protecting commerce within that country against foreign competition

> Protect your domestic producers

Methods of enactment:

- Tariffs
- Import quotas
- Subsidies for local businesses
- Export subsidies

These are designed to add to the competitiveness of local businesses

### Are we protectionist

The EU provides a single market, with no barriers to trade. When Brexit is enacted, unless free trade deals are enacted, tariffs will go up and there will be more protectionism

The less elastic supply and demand are, the more imports a county will purchase, and tariffs will have a bigger effects.
