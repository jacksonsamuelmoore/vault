### Starter

1. Pricing power is important because it lets the firms maximise their own profit, letting them choose what type of efficiency they want
2. Barriers to entry are important as they dictate how many and how good the competition will be in the market, therefore how likely that there will be a monopoly or oligopoly and how much pricing power the firm will have
3. PINSIDE: Pricing power, Information symmetry, Number of firms, Size of firms, Interdependence, Differentiation, Entry/Exit  barriers
4. In perfect competition: No price control, High information symmetry, Many firms, Small firms, no interdependence, no differentiation of the product, no barriers

### Long Run

![[Perfect Competition/Untitled.png]]

In industry, prices are determined at S=D, P1, Q1. P1=AR=MR. Firm chooses MR=MC as profit max, hence chooses P1, Q1. Normal profits made only

In the long run:

Allocative: Yes. Dynamic: No (no incentive to innovate). Productive: Yes (only the most ruthless cost cutters survive)

### Short Run

In the short run:

Allocative: Yes. Dynamic: Incentive to make supernormal profits. Productive: Can be inefficient

### Is perfect competition desirable?

- Allocatively efficient in the long run (consumer and producer surplus are max)
- Dynamic efficient (no retained profits - invested in industry)
- Productively efficient in the long run (costs driven down in the long run)
- No choice for consumers
- No economies of scale as firms are too small

### Is it achievable

- Most firms have some price setting power
- Dominance in real world markets of brands
- Highly complex products, there's always information gaps
- Impossible to remove search costs
- Patents need to be removed
- Rare for entry to be costless

### Essay Plan: Evaluate the view that all kinds of efficiency are maximized in perfect competition

Points:

- Long run, no dynamic efficeny
- Short run, not always productive efficiency
- Maybe yes allocatively efficient, but then there's no choice

### Maximization

- Profit max: MC=MR
- Revenue max: MR=0
- Sales max: AC=AR
