### Starter

Why might a fall in exchange not better the trade deficit?

- Recession in importing nations
- Other factors reducing competitiveness like tariffs or inflation

### Marshall-Lerner condition

> Devaluation of the exchange rate will lead to net improvement in the trade balance provided that the sum of the P.E.D. for exports and imports is grater than 1

It all depends on whether we gain more or less revenue from a fall in price, which depends on the elasticity of our goods

### J-Curve

- In the short term net export are inelastic
    - Take some time to realise and discover lower/higher prices
- People realise and elasticity changes
- Trade balance improves
