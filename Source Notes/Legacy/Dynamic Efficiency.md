### Starter

1. Describe four different types of business growth
    1. Internal/Organic
    2. External
        1. Forward Vertical integration
        2. Backward Vertical integration
        3. Horizontal integration
2. .
    1. Backward Vertical integration:  +Supply chain control (artificial advantage to self), -Monopoly red tape
    2. Horizontal: +Price control/More market share, -Monopoly red tape

### Allocative efficiency

> Allocative efficiency is when scarce resources are allocated efficiently, when marginal benefit = marginal cost (and price/average revenue = marginal cost)

Hence from this we can see that the point of allocative efficiency is at the point of supply = demand

Supply is *technically* marginal cost

In this situation, producer and consumer surplus are maximized, and it is allocatively efficient

Competition leads to allocatively efficiency

### Dynamic efficiency

> Dynamic efficiency is efficiency over time. It is caused by product and process innovation

Dynamic efficiency is at the point where MC=MR, where profit is maximized. The PPF will also shift out

Policies:

- Patent laws to promote creation of new goods by protecting profits
- Competition to incentivise innovations
- Cutting corporation tax for reinvestment
- Decreased shareholder returns
- State aid for R&D

### Allocative vs Productive vs Dynamic

1. Dynamic
2. Allocative
3. Productive

Why?

Dynamic, while messing with not allocating efficiently in the short run, it arguably provides more long term bonuses

Mr East arguments:

Allocative should be put first, and while dynamic has some advantages
