### Starter

Mass Spectrometer:

Ionisation: ions need to be charged in order for them to be affected by electric or magnetic fields.

Accelerating voltage: for the ion to be affected by the magnetic field, it needs a velocity: F = Bqv

Velocity selector: only particles with a certain velocity pass through. Electric force balances the magnetic force so qE = Bqv

Therefore only the velocity v = E/B can pass through.

Magnetic field region: the greater the mass, the greater the radius of the semicircle described by the particle. Relevant equation: r = mv/Bq

Useful for finding mass
