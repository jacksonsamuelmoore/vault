### Charging

Taking a circuit with two components, one being a capacitor, there will be 2 measurable voltages, $V_c \text{ and } V_r$  with $V_0$ as the EMF. As the capacitor is charged, the voltage increases on it and decreases on the other component. This can be utilized to create the equation $V_c=V_0-V_0e^{-t/RC}$ for voltage, $Q=Q_0-Q_0e^{-t/RC}$ for charge and $I=I_0e^{-t/RC}$ for the current (current is same as discharging)

$W=0.5QV$

### Q's

1. $Q=9.9*10^{-4}$
2. $Q=1.35*10^{-3}$
3. When $t\approx 4RC=200s$ (approx. 98% charged)

### Uses of capacitors

- Compact
- Easy to chage

- Can release energy quickly
    - High power output
- Builds up large amounts of energy

The main use is for "Smoothing" where AC current is converted to DC current
