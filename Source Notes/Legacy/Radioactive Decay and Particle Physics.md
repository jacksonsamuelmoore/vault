1.  $_z^aX$
    1. $a$: Mass number  $z$: Atomic number
    2. $a$: Neutrons add protons $z$: Number of protons
2. A substance made of the same type of atom
3. Elements are formed in nuclear fusion in stars, during their creation and supernova
4. After creation, elements immediately begin radioactive decay

Quarks: Up, Down, Top, Bottom, Strange, Charm (and corresponding anti-particles)

Leptons: Electron, Muon, Tau (and corresponding neutrinos)

When high energy photons collide with nuclei, a process called pair production happens, producing an electron and a positron

### Universe/Element formation:

1. Quark-Lepton soup: universe is too hot and dense
2. Hadron era: The Quarks form groups of three creating protons and neutrons (hadrons)
3. "A bunch of gas": The protons and electrons form hydrogen and helium (~75% Hydrogen ~25% Helium)
4. Heavier elements formed in fusion as stars are created - the heavier the element the larger the star
5. More heavy elements such as gold and uranium are formed in supernova

### What Happens next?

Either:

1. Some elements are stable: they remain as they are for millions of years
2. Some are unstable: IE they decay. They are radioactive.
