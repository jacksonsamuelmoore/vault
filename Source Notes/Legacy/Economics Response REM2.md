### What went well

- I was able to effectively get the general idea of the answer to most questions
- I can identify the cause of changes or specific positions in diagrams
- There wasn't one question on the paper where I genuinely thought I had no idea how to answer

### To improve

Pretty much only one thing: CHAIN OF ANALYSIS

In almost very question I lost marks in, it was not because I didn't understand but because I missed a step in the chain of analysis, causing one or two lost marks. There was a question where I lost marks only for not mentioning the specific points on the diagram that moved. This is easy stuff, which I should be getting right.

### Plan to improve

My plan is to directly tackle the issue of chain of analysis. In an exam, particularly one as limited as this one, there were not very many types of question. My plan is to analyse the types of questions and create generalised criteria that exist regardless of subject matter. I then will delve into more specifics. creating requirements for specific subject matters such as monopolies. I'd also like to try link this to mark numbers but that may prove difficult

## General exam question types - Taken from REM2 Assessment

### The diagram movement question: 3+ marks

- Must state the diagram movement with specific labels (eg Q1-Q2) - 1 mark
- Use a relevant example in the explanation (eg profit motive) - 1 mark - This is anything that is potentially custom about the shift, and has many choices to be able to use. Do not forget it, you will loose a mark
- Generalised explanation - 1+ marks - This  depends on the question, but the general part of the analysis will have most likely been drilled into your head, and if not you definitely have content knowledge issues rather than chain of analysis issues

### The diagram position question: 3+ marks

- Explaining why the diagram is shaped as such - 1+ marks - I didn't do this in the paper and it's worth a lot. Even if the explanation doesn't look like it has to do with the shape, it probably does
- State and sometimes explain the current position of relevant parts of the curve - 1 mark
- Use the above to explain the extended part of the question - 1+ marks

### The explain question (no diagram): 3+ marks

- Usually:
    1. Firm does X
    2. Because Y
    3. Which has impact Z
    4. And follow on impact A

## General exam question types - Other extended types

### The 6-mark explainer: 6 marks

- The diagram: ~2-3 marks
    - Correct diagram and curve positions
    - Axis labels
    - Point labels
- The explanation: ~3-4 marks
    - Shift
    - Reason
    - Moved point
    - Extend
    - Reason
    - Moved point

### The 8-mark explainer - diagramless: 8 marks

- This often is comparing two things
- Provide 4 points
- Each should compare specific aspects
- Conclusion sometimes needed
