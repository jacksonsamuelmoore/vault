### Terms of trade

A countries terms of trade are a measure of efficiency for that country. It defined as a ratio between value of exports and value of imports. The TOT can be said to be the amount of goods a country can buy per unit of exports

${exports \over imports}*100=TOT$

If you are a county where there is decreasing TOT, then perhaps specializing is not necessarily good, and despite a comparative advantage, specialization will still cause you to have to produce more, it could be said that there is an unseen opportunity cost of specialization. Here it would be beneficial to diversify, and this can often require protectionist policies to protect infant industries.

### Measuring terms of trade

Terms of trade, like inflation, is calculated using a CPI like method. This involves taking a weighted average of thousands of products for import an export prices to create an index for the TOT

### Improving vs worsening

When the TOT is improving, this is when the value is going up. This means that there are more exports and less  imports, and the country can buy more goods per unit exported. The same is the opposite with worsening or "deteriorating".

### Questions

1. 2015: $TOT=124.44/123.38=100.86$ 2016: $TOT=107.45/111.87=96.05$
2. Between 2011 and 2016 there is falling terms of trade index, after the recent spike in 2010

    This is caused by 2 things, the fall in copper prices and the depreciation in the exchange rate. A fall in copper prices will mean that global firms are more competitive with the Zambian firms, meaning they'll be less likely to buy Zambian copper exports, causing falling exports index. The depreciation in the exchange rate will cause a fall in imports as
