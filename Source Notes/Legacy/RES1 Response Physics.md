### Prologue

Usually, my responses follow a generally similar format each time. They open with correction, move to what I observed about my mistakes, uses those observations to plan interventions, and then enacts that intervention. This time, however, things are slightly different. Due to my abysmal score on this mock, change is required. Extreme scores require extreme measures. In this case it becomes worth using the correction process as part of the action.

It was my observation even from leaving the exam that one of my very important failings in this exam was time. I did not plan and effectively use my time to answer. Hence there are going to be two parts to this correction. The first will be all the non-MCQs. All of these I will attempt to mark as fast as possible without looking at the mark scheme. For everyplace I look at the mark scheme I will put the line in red, and each question will have a time after it.

### Corrections Part 1: non-MCQs

These begin from question 21

1. .
    1. $F=ma\rArr8700=2300a\rArr a=3.782$
    2. $S1=0.97*22=21.34\\v^2=u^2+2as\rArr 0=22^2+2*3.782*S2\rArr S2=63.98\\S_t=21.34+63.98\approx85$
    3. $22m/s=79200m/h\approx50mph$
    4. .
        - Difference between cars and trucks:
            - Heavier=slower brake= longer brake
            - Different reaction times
        - Thinking distance longer: Tired?

2. .
    1. Moments up = moments down

        $1.6Tcos(30)=9.81((1.8*95)+(1*120))\\T={2855\over 1.6cos(30)}=3600N$

    2. $\sigma={3600\over \pi*0.015^2}=5100kPa$
    3. The increase in acceleration increases the moment in that direction, as moment=xma, and so therefore the moment in the other direction must increase and so T must increase

3. .
    1. Potential Difference: The electrical energy transfered per unit of charge to other forms of energy
    2. The energy lost inside the battery/power source from diving the charges. The source acts as if there is a restive component in it.
    3. The potential difference across each parallel section is the same. The resistance of X is 6V and the resistance of Y+Z is 12V. Considering V=IR and that current must be split between branches, current in X must be twice YZ.
    4. $V=IR\rArr0.08*6=0.48$
    5. The potential difference across the 3 ohm resistor is the same as the potential difference across the 6 ohm resistor because of the difference between sharing the p.d. between a total of 6 ohms (for the 3 ohm) and 12 ohms (for the 6 ohm). The means that connecting them will create a p.d. of zero as they cancel each other.
    6. $\text{EMF}=V=Ir=0.96\\r_I=0.16+0.08=0.24A\\1.2=0.96+0.24r=1.0$

    14:20: 13 marks: ~1.1 Marks/min

4. .
    1. $0.5m\bar{c}^2={3\over2}kT\\\bar{c}^2=3*1.38*10^{-23}*523/4*10^{-26}\\\bar{c}=670$
    2. $N=1.3*6.02*10^{23}\\\bar{KE}=3/2*1.38*10^{-23}*523\\KE_{total}=8.5*10^3$
5. .
    1. $\omega^2=g/L\\\omega=2\pi /T\\T^2=4L\pi^2/g$
    2. There is friction that causes a loss in energy, therefore creating a loss in amplitude over time
6. .
    1. Power per unit area
    2. .
        1. density = $mass/{4\over 3}\pi r^2=mass/r^3\\ratio={12\over(1.1*10^5)^3}\\=9*10^{-15}$
        2. P= intensity * surface area

            $P\propto T^4r^2\\ratio=1.1*10^7$

7. The big bang: the creation and rapid expansion of the universe
    - Microwave background radiation
    - Existance of primordial helium and other lighter elements
8. .
    1. $2.2*10^{-11}$
    2. .
        1. $C=1000+500=1500\mu F$
        2. $V=1.5*e^{-12/15}=0.67$
9. .
    1. [Diagram Question]
    2. $V=4.3*10^6$
10. The magnitude of the electric potential from the particles is equal and opposite meaning that the total potential at the point is zero
11. $\lambda=ln2/6600\\N={400*10^6 \over \lambda}\\mass=1.15*10^{-12}$

### Intermission

In the next section I will use the MCQs to identify my areas of weakness by correcting the question I got wrong and identifying the relevant study area

### Areas that need more work next time

The following areas are ones that have been identified to need extra revision next exam, and this list will be consulted when deciding what and when to study:

- Particle physics
    - Half Life
    - Isotopes
    - Quarks and leptons
- (Lightly) Capacitors
