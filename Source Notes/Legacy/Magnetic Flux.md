- Move magnet through current creates EMF
- Faster magnet ⇒ more EMF

### Magnetic flux

- Magnetic flux is generally the amount of field lines passing through a given area
- For coils clockwise, field lines go into the coil/page
- Flux ⇒ $\varphi = BAcos(\theta )$
- Flux unit is a Weber, or Newton-meters/Amp
- $N\varphi = NBA = NBA cos(\theta )$ is flux linkage (in Weber-turns)

    Where N is the number of coil turns

### Q's

1. $0.006\text{ Weber-turns}$
2. Turns has no effect on flux, only on linkage, so therefore angle has a greater effect

### Faraday's law

Work done = $BIL\Delta s$

$Q=I\Delta t$

⇒ $V=BL\Delta s/\Delta t =B\Delta A/\Delta t = \Delta\varphi/\Delta T= -N\Delta\varphi/\Delta t$

### Lenz Law

> The force you feel is always opposite to the motion of the magnet.
