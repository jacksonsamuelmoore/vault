### Starter

1. Allocative efficiency: Where AR is MC and demand is equal to supply. Perfect allocation of resources
2. Productive: Producing at lowest cost, i.e. MC=AC
3. Dynamic: Producing where supernormal profits are re-invested in the firm
4. PINSIDE
    - Price power
    - Information symmetry
    - Number of firms
    - Size of firms
    - Interdependence
    - Differetiation of product
    - Entry/Exit Barriers

### Perfect Competition

PINSIDE:

- Price power: None
- Information symmetry: Perfect
- Number of firms: Very many
- Size of firms: Small
- Interdependence: High
- Differentiation of product: None
- Entry/Exit Barriers: None

Why is the demand curve perfectly elastic?

The demand curve is perfectly elastic because the firms have no price setting power, meaning that if the price moves at all the demand will immediately shrink to nothing. There's also perfect substitutability

Can firms make supernormal profits or a loss in short run? Yes

Long run

Because firms have perfect information symmetry, they will begin to leave the industry as they are making a loss. This shifts inward supply and price is raised to be at normal profit levels. (This situation would be inversed if firms made short term supernormal profit)

This makes the firm allocatively efficient as they're at the point of AR=MC, or demand = supply. They're also productively efficient as cost are at their lowest. They are not dynamically efficient as there are no profits to reinvest

### Monopolistic Competition

PINSIDE:

- Pricing power: Some
- Information symmetry: Some
- Number of firms: Many
- Size of firms: Small
- Interdependence: Some
- Differentiation of Product: Some
- Entry/Exit barriers: Low

How do firms compete?

Firms compete with price, trying to undercut other firms. They also compete with quality, introducing bundles, membership schemes and advertising

In the long run, the perfect information and profits will incentivise more entrants, increasing supply and reducing firms demand to the point where they're only making supernormal profit.
