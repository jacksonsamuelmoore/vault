### Early tips

1. Make sure to use the data
2. Don't just quote it back
3. Don't be afraid to critique the data if it is inadequate to answer the provided question
4. Perhaps annotate rather than highlight
5. Beware of implied concepts within the data

### Data Extraction: Trump's policies

- $1T infrastructure projects → supply side policy and govt spending
- Tax cuts → fiscal policy (trickle down vs helicopter) → regressive tax policy
- Deregulation → supply side again → workers rights and the environment
- Trade reform & tariffs → major focus on protectionism
    - 20% on Mexican goods → most favoured nation problem>
    - pulling out of free trade agreements
    - Chinese dumping → most favoured nation problem ⇒ is china a national security threat?
- Data shows globalising countries growing much faster than non-globalising ones → opposite to Trumps promise of 1% growth increase → data also incomplete, only till 1990 & correlation does not mean causation
- US growth roughly stable at 2% → Spare capacity? 2% < Trend rate, negative output gap?
- Balance of trade diagram → trade deficit, greatly fell after 2008 (lower income = less imports), roughly sable since

### Q1: Tariffs and the border wall

![[Data Response/Untitled.png]]

When tariffs are applied to imports from Mexico, cost are imposed on the goods being imported. This cost is often passed directly onto the consumer in the form of raised prices. As shown on diagram 1 when a tariff is applied the price of imports rises (P2-P3) and the quantity of imports directly falls (Q4-Q2) due to an inward movement along the demand curve from the income effect. This extra money (box Q2-Q3*P3-P2) is taken by the US government, which Trump suggests will be used to finance the border wall. However, as stated before, most often tariffs are directly passed to consumers, meaning that US consumers are paying for the tariffs and therefore the border wall. There's also loss of consumer surplus and negative externalities of border wall construction.

Note: the more elastic the product demand, the more the exporter will have to shoulder the burden of the tariff

### Q2: Immigration and trade reform

There are many reasons that trade reforms can be argued to be both good and bad for the US economy. Taking for example the pulling out of free trade agreements such as TPP and NAFTA stated in the extract "Trump: Let's make America great again" and 20% tariffs on Mexican goods. Pulling out of trade agreements can be suggested to be a good thing. Without the burden of trade agreements, the Us can impose tariffs on  many countries (especially with the OPEC appeals body out of action) and this can leads to boosts in demand for domestic goods, so more domestic workers will be hired and national incomes might go up.

However imposing the tariffs means that prices rise, which directly cases inflation, and rising national incomes also cause this issue.
