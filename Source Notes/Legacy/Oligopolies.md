### Starter

PINSIDE:

- Price power: High
- Information symmetry: Low-Medium
- Number of firms: Few (2-10)
- Size: Large
- Interdependence: High
- Differentiation of product: Some
- Entry/Exit Barrier: High

Examples:

- Smartphones
- Supermarket
- Soft drinks

### Measuring market share

Market share is measured with the n-firm concentration ratio: either by shares in output of by shares in employment

### Strategic interdependence

- This is where your actions are influenced by the likely behaviour of your competitors
- $\begin{array}{c|c|c}
    & cut &raise \\ \hline
   cut & £50-£50 & £5-£90 \\ \hline raise &  £90-£5 & £10-£10
\end{array}$
- Game theory shows that in an oligopoly that in every case firms will end up in a cut-cut situation
    1. If Firm A initially rises prices, the Firm B will cut prices to gain the extra profit, forcing Firm A to also cut prices
    2. This makes the dominant strategy to cut prices
    3. And the equilibrium to be cut-cut
    4. This explains collusion because if both firms can collude to raise prices, they can both get £50 compared to the inevitable £10, but it's unlikely to last in the long run
    5. This explains price wars as one firm lowers by a small amount and the other has incentive to follow
    6. This explains price stability as there becomes no incentive to raise price above the equilibrium. This also makes firms more likely to compete on non-price factors
- This diagram isn't quite complex enough for real life
- Most firms rely on rules of thumb
- There is too much information asymmetry

### Collusion

Collusion: An agreement to restrict competition and maximise benefits. When this is wide ranging with market dominance it is called a cartel

Overt collusion: open for everyone to see (eg OPEC)

Covert collusion: happening behind closed doors

Tacit collusion: where firms don't make any formal agreements but cooperate closely (eg private school price fixing scandal)

For this to function, there needs to be several things:

- An agreement
- A way to prevent cheating
- Restricted competition (high barriers to entry)
- Consumer inertia (consumers will put up with small price raises)

Advantages:

- Dynamic efficiency?
- Increase government revenue from exports - oil exports accounting for lots of OPEC countries revenues
- Can help against monopsonies

Disadvantages:

- Not allocatively efficient
- Not productively efficient
- High prices
- Reduced surplus

Reasons for breakdown:

- Falling reliance on product
- Cheaters
- Whistle blowers
