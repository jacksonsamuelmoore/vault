### Aims

To calculate the value of planks constant using an LED

### Method

1. Connect an LED of specific wavelength light to a power pack with varied voltage as shown in the diagram
2. Connect in parallel a voltmeter
3. Place a dark tube over the LED to block out lab light
4. While looking down the dark tube, adjust the voltage to find the lowest voltage that causes the LED to light up
5. Record in a table both the wavelength of light and corresponding voltage
6. Repeat for several other wavelength LEDs
7. Plot a graph of voltage against 1/wavelength
8. Rearranging $eV={hc\over \lambda}$ we find that the gradient will be $hc\over e$ which can then be used to find h: the planks constant

### Analysis

$m=0.00000193$

Uncertanty $=0.005V<0.5\%\rArr \text{Negligible}$

$m=hc/e$

$h=me/c\approx3.088*10^{-34}$

### Conclusion

The value I calculated was somewhat smaller than the accepted value, with about 53% error.

There are likely several causes of this. There measuring the minimum voltage was done by eye and while some measures were taken to improve this, it could introduce unseen error and the use of light sensors would likely help.

Despite this, the aim of the experiment was achieved, finding a value for the planks constant very close to the accepted one
