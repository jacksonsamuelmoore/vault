### Starter

1. Contestability: A market where there are low barriers to entry and the threat of competition is always imminent
2. We say contestable markets are best because they allows for many different practical market structures while doing well to negate the bad effects of certain ones such monopolies and oligopolies by forcing them to be more dynamically efficient - invest in product development rather than taking more profit, and more productively and allocatively efficient

### Main pillars of policy

- Anti-trust
- Liberalisation
- State aid control
- Merger control

### Judgements for policy

- Real Prices
- Size of profits and level of reinvestment
- Gains in jobs
- Performance targets
- Research spending
- Productivity improvements
- Environmental indicators
- Investment in new capacity

### Price capping

- Capping is the approptriate way to curtail the porwer from a natural monopoly
- Cuts in real price levels are good for consumers

Against:

- Could lead to job losses
- Might not set the price caps in future years
- Firms might end up controlling the regulator "Regulatory capture"

### Nationalisation

Should we nationalise the water industry?

Effects:

- Competition: Unchanged
- Contestability: Down
- Efficiency: Down
- Quality: Up
- Prices: Up except for subsidies
- Investment: Reduced
- Profits: Reduced
- The Economy: Better for consumers and workers

## Market Failure

Market failure:

- Disequilibrium in labour market
- Price dumping
-

### Externalises
