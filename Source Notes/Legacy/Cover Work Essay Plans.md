### Plan 1: Are Cartels Efficient?

Intro:

- Introduce the many types of efficiency
- Introduce cartels - focus on mechanism of price fixing
- One example - maybe OPEC?

PEEL1:

- Point: Cartels are not allocatively efficient
- Evidence: Firm Diagram - show not at MC=AR
- Explain: Cartels artificially restrict supply - intentional move away from
- Link: Is one point against them being efficient

PEEL2:

- Point: Cartels are not productively efficient
- Evidence: Firm Diagram - show not at lowest AC
- Explain: Cartels artificially restrict supply and raises price - cost will be slightly higher
- Link: Is one point against them being efficient

PEEL3:

- Point: Cartels are dynamically efficient
- Evidence: Firm Diagram - show large profits - example: Big tech or supermarkets
- Explain: Cartels artificially increase profits - allows for reinvestment - hence dynamic efficiency
- Link: Is one point for them being efficient

Conslusion:

- While somewhat efficient, mostly inefficient
- This is an intentional choice
