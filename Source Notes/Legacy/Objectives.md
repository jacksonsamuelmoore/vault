### Starter

1. Why would a firm want to/not want to maximize:
    1. Revenue:
        - Less market share vs sales max
        - Less profit vs profit max
        - Less EoS
        - Lower prices/costs vs Profit max
    2. Market power:
        - Increases EoS
        - Lower costs and prices
        - Higher barriers of entry
2. Draw a loss making perfectly competitive market in SR and LR

### The final goal: Profit Satisficing

- Satisficing is a term meaning attempting to take into account a number of different competing objectives, without an attempt to maximise one
- Practically, this means firms sacrifice some profit to satisfy as many different stakeholders

### What motive will dominate?

1. NHS - Very large mostly monopoly company with government managers
    - Looking for largest market share and lowering costs
    - Looking after voters

### Conclusion

Most business are profit seekers, but are not profit maximisers, as to not destroy themselves, and they often learn from experience, iterating on objective weights year on year
