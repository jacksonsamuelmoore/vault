### Section 1

- Private costs are the costs faced by the producer or consumer directly involved in a transaction
- Private benefits are the benefits for producer and/or consumer directly involved in an economic transaction
- The existence of externalities creates a divergence between private and social costs of production and the private and social benefits of consumption
- Social Cost = Private Cost + External Cost
- Social Benefit = Private Benefit + External Benefit
- When negative externalities exist, social costs exceed private cost. This leads to over-production and market failure if producers do not take into account the externalities
- When positive externalities occur, social benefits exceed private benefit – this can also lead to market failure
