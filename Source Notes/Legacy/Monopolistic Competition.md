### Example: Hairdressers

PINSIDE:

1. Pricing power: Some
2. Information symmetry: Some
3. Size of firms: Small
4. Number of firms: Many
5. Interdependence: Low
6. Product differentiation: Some
7. Entry/Exit barriers: Low

Chain of analysis:

- AR is downward sloping as they have some pricing power
- Firm is profit max, so price at MC=MR

    ![[Monopolistic Competition/Untitled 4.png]]

- (now long run) Profit signals to more firms to join the market
- AR falls so only normal profits are made
- MR=MC is AR=AC

### Observations

In monopolistic competitions, the market is in constant flux, as innovation happens all the time and so product lifecycles happen all the time. In monopolistic competition there's often quite low prices as competition constantly lowers them. In this competition, there's a lot of creative destruction, typically considered a good thing. The advantage of monopolistic competition over perfect competition is consumer choice

### Would you rather?

From a producers point of view, they would definitely like monopolistic competition more

From the economy's point of view, it's difficult to argue for monopolistic competition as it doesn't really solve the basic economic competition

Technically, consumers would want perfect competition as they care only about prices, however in reality consumers are a little more complex than that
