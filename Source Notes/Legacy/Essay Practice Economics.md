### Explain why firms might not aim to maximize profits and instead pursue other objectives

There are several different objectives the firms may pursue, but all firms have one fundamental choice that they can make - how much of their product they produce. It's this choice that leads to the consideration of the two main motives: profit and sales. As shown in the diagram below, when a firm produces less, they're likely to get closer to their maximum profit (profit being the difference between the AC curve price at the point and the AR curve price at that point) and producing more (and therefore creating more sales) causes less profit. It is the reason for choosing a particular balance that the firm must consider

One reason a firm might not maximise profits is that they might be aiming for a monopoly. Companies such as amazon intentionally align themselves elsewhere on diagram 1 in a direct attempt to increase market share. the practice is often called 'predatory pricing' and is one way for a firm to gain more control in the market. The strategy here is to lower prices as much as possible or maximise output as much as possible to the point where supply=demand or P3-Q3 on diagram 1. This means firms will have a larger number of sales, often which are taken directly away from smaller firms, meaning those firms often go out of business or become much to small to compete, handing market share and power directly to the main firm. This will allow them secure a oligopoly or maybe a monopoly in the long run, allowing them to rake in much higher profits then after raising barriers to entry, or for the firm to survive for a long time.

Another reason firms might not profit maximise is that the different people who run a firm may have different interests in mind. For small, mostly owner run firms, the goals are clear - the owner will want to make back as much of the sunk and entrepreneurial costs as possible - the reward for entrepreneurship is profits. However when firms grow this becomes more complicated. The first people involved are managers. Managers have a totally different goal to firm owners. Managers often don't get a cut of the profit, they just get a fixed salary (at least in the short run). This means that managers often have one main goal in the short run: Keep the firm alive, to keep their salary. This means that mangers often go for more market share rather than more profit, with the aim to keep the company alive in the long run. Goals get even more confusing when other stakeholder such as shareholders and investors come into play, who often push for more profits. Here managers have to balance interests, because it is these people that their job is reliant on as well as the continued existence of the company, so they have to balance profits and market share to appeal to all. This is called 'profit satisficing' and need for it is often the reason that firms don't maximize profit.

Finally, there are a few more miscellaneous reasons that firms might not want to maximise profits. For one, they might want to take advantage of economies of scale, to grow the business to then maximise future profits. They might want to increase brand loyalty. This especially helps in market structures with limits on competition, and where brand loyalty is the only way to gain over competitors. This is also a good way to push another agenda, like a newspaper supported by a political party. In the end, most of these reasons all have to do with growing the business and it's influence at the sacrifice of profits.
